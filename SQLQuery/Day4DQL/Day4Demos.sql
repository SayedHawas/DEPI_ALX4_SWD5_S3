/*
-- 1) Understanding Joins :-
----------------------------
   - T-SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables.
   A) The FROM Clause and Virtual Tables :- 
   -------------------------------------
    - Virtual table will hold the output of the FROM clause and,
	   will be used subsequently by other phases of the SELECT statement, such as the WHERE clause.
	- The virtual table created by a FROM clause is a logical entity only. In SQL Server 2016, no physical table is created.
	- Table aliases improves the readability of the query, without affecting the performance.
	- It is strongly recommended that you use table aliases in your multi-table queries. 
  B) Join Terminology: Cartesian Product :- 
  ---------------------------------------
   - Cartesian product is the product of two sets. The product of a set of 2 items and a set of 6 items is a set of 12 items.
   - The product of a table with 10 rows and a table with 100 rows is a result set with 1,000 rows.  
   - Cartesian product occurs when two input tables are joined without considering any logical relationships.  
  C) Overview of Join Types :- 
  ------------------------------
   - (CROSS JOIN) adds all possible combinations of the two input tables' rows to the virtual table. Any filtering of the                      rows will happen in a WHERE clause. this operator is to be avoided. 
   -  (INNER JOIN) creates a Cartesian product, then filters the results using the predicate supplied in the ON clause,                         removing any rows from the virtual table that do not satisfy the predicate.
                   inner join is a very common type of join for retrieving rows with attributes that match across tables,
	               such as matching Customers to Orders by a common custid.  
   - (OUTER JOIN) creates a Cartesian product, then filters the results to find rows that match in each table. However,
                  all rows from one table are preserved, added back to the virtual table after the initial filter is applied.                  NULLs are placed on attributes where no matching values are found.

  D) T-SQL Syntax Choices :- 
  ---------------------------
   
           - Through the history of versions of SQL Server, 
		     the product has changed to keep pace with changes in the ANSI standards for the SQL language.
		   - In ANSI SQL-89, no (ON) operator was defined. 

		   - This syntax of ANSI SQL-89 is still supported by SQL Server 2016.
		   - ANSI SQL-89-style joins can easily become Cartesian products and cause performance problems. 
		   - The ANSI SQL-92 standard, support for the ON clause was added.
		   - The logical relationship between the tables is represented with the ON clause.
		   - As performance of query optimizer in SQL Server does not favor one syntax over the other.

/*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 2) Querying with Inner Joins :- 
------------------------------------------
     A) Understanding Inner Joins :-
	 -------------------------------
	    - selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns in both tables.
		- INNER JOIN are the most common types of queries to solve many business problems,
		  especially in highly normalized database environments.
		-  By expressing a logical relationship between the tables, 
		   you will retrieve only those rows with matching attributes present in both tables.
     B) Inner Join Syntax :- 
	 ------------------------
	   - Table aliases are preferred not only for the SELECT list, but also for expressing the ON clause.  
	   - INNER JOIN may be performed on a single matching attribute, or on multiple matching attributes.
	     Joins that match multiple attributes are called composite joins
	   - The order in which tables are listed and joined in the FROM clause does not matter to the SQL Server optimizer.
	   - Use the JOIN keyword once for each two tables in the FROM list. For a two-table query, specify one join.
	   - In Syntax both working :-  
		      A) With INNER     ( INNER JOIN )
			  B) Without INNER  ( JOIN )              -- Default Join is Inner in SQL .

	C) Inner Join Examples :- 
	-------------------------
*/

-- JOIN on a single matching attribute :-
USE Northwind
SELECT P.ProductID,P.ProductName,OD.Quantity,OD.Quantity
FROM   Products AS P JOIN   [Order Details] AS OD
ON  P.ProductID = OD.ProductID
GO

-- JOIN on two matching attributes :-
USE Northwind
SELECT DISTINCT C.City, C.Country
FROM   Employees AS E JOIN   Customers AS C
ON     E.Country = C.Country AND    E.City    = C.City        -- Result show Unique cities & countries in matches in both tables.
GO

-- Example For extended JOIN OR Multiple Join Or Nested Join :-
USE Northwind
SELECT E.EmployeeID,E.FirstName + ' ' + E.LastName AS 'Employee Name',C.CustomerID,C.CompanyName AS  'Customer Name',
	   O.OrderID,O.OrderDate
FROM   Customers AS C JOIN   Orders AS O
ON     C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID JOIN   Employees AS E
ON     O.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID
GO                                     -- Result Show Data from 3 tables .
/*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -- Lesson 3) Querying with Outer Joins :-
 ------------------------------------------
   A) Understanding Outer Joins :-
   -------------------------------
        - Will retrieve not only rows with matching attributes,
		  but all rows present in one of the tables, whether or not there is a match in the other table.
		- Outer Joins :- 
		        LEFT OUTER :-  returns all rows from the left table with the matching rows in the right table. 
				               The result is NULL in the right side when there is no match.
				RIGHT OUTER :- returns all rows from the right table with the matching rows in the left table.
				               The result is NULL in the left side when there is no match.
				FULL OUTER :-  returns all rows from the left table and All from the right table. 
				               FULL OUTER JOIN combines the result of both LEFT and RIGHT joins.
	B) Outer Join Syntax :- 
	------------------------
	    - Outer joins are expressed using the keywords LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL preceding OUTER JOIN. 
		- As with inner joins, may be performed on a single matching attribute or on multiple matching attributes.
		- Unlike inner joins, the order in which tables are listed and joined in the FROM clause does matter,
		  because it will determine whether you choose LEFT or RIGHT for your join. 
        - To display only rows where no match exists,
		  add a test for NULL in a WHERE clause following an OUTER JOIN predicate. 
		- In Syntax both working :-
		      A) With OUTER ( LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN  )
			  B) Without OUTER  ( LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN  
   C) Outer Join Examples :- 
   -------------------------
*/
-- Example for displays all customers and provides information about each customer's orders if any exist :-
USE Northwind
SELECT  C.CompanyName,C.Country,O.OrderDate
FROM    Customers AS C LEFT JOIN Orders AS O
ON   C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
GO
-- Example displays only customers that have never placed an order:-
USE Northwind
SELECT  C.CompanyName,C.Country,O.OrderDate
FROM    Customers AS C LEFT JOIN Orders AS O
ON   C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
WHERE O.CustomerID IS NULL
GO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
-- Lesson 4) Querying with Cross Joins and Self-Joins :-
---------------------------------------------------------
  A) Understanding Cross Join :-  also called " Cartesian products " .
  -----------------------------
      - return all rows from the left table,
        Each row from the left table is combined with all rows from the right table.
	  - Combine each row from first table with each row from second table.
  B) Cross Join Syntax :-
  ------------------------
     - There is no matching of rows performed, and therefore no ON clause is required.

/*
    C) Understanding Self-Joins :-

-- Module 8) Using Built-In Functions :- 
 -----------------------------------------
   -- Lessons :-
   -------------
          - Writing Queries with Built-In Functions.
		  - Using Conversion Functions.
		  - Using Logical Functions.
		  - Using Functions to Work with NULL.
-----------------------------------------------
-- What is Functions in T-SQL ?
--------------------------------
 - A T-SQL routine that accepts parameters, performs an action, such as a complex calculation,
     and returns the result of that action as a value.
 - Functions hide the steps and the complexity from other code.
 - Function Operate  
                      A)- (Deterministic = return same result)
                      B)- (Non-Deterministic = may return different result each time) 
					  
-- Why We use Functions ? 
--------------------------
   - Functions can Use & Run almost anywhere .
   - To replace a stored procedure . 
   
   -- Functions Types :-
-------------------------
 1)- User-defined Functions :-       "Developing Course"

                             A) Scalar        :- Return a single value.
							 B) Table-Valued  :- Return a table.

 
 2)- Built-in Function :-   
                             A) Scalar    :- Working on a single row To return a single Value.             " Module Focus "
							 B) Aggregate :- Take one or more input To return a single summarizing value.  " Next Module "
							 C) Window    :- Working on sets of rows.                                      " In This Course"
							 D) Rowset    :- Return a virtual table can be used in a T-SQL statement.      "Admin Course"
*/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Simple Examples For The Types of Built-in Functions That we will use :-
-- 1) Scalar Simple Example 
SELECT orderid,orderdate,YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear   -- Scalar
FROM   Orders

-- 2) Aggregate Simple Example 
Select count(*) from Employees
SELECT COUNT(Quantity) AS RowsCount, AVG(Quantity) AS QuantityAverage
FROM  [Order Details]

-- 3) Window Simple Example 
SELECT TOP(10) productid, productname,unitprice,
	   RANK() OVER(ORDER BY unitprice DESC) AS 'Rank By Price' 
FROM   Products 
ORDER BY 'Rank By Price' 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


/*
-- Using Conversion Functions :-
--------------------------------
  - Implicit conversion occurs automatically :- Follows data type precedence rules.

                                A) When implicit would fail or is not permitted.
                                B) To override data type precedence.
 - Conversion Functions :- 
                           A) CAST    :-  To convert a value from one data type to another . " ANSI-Standard "
						   B) CONVERT :-  To convert a value from one data type to another . " SQL SERVER ONLY "
						   C) PARSE  :-  Converts strings to date, time, number types.     " SQL SERVER ONLY "  
						   D) TRY_PARS & TRY_CONVERT :-  like PARSE and CONVERT, But when failed conversions return NULL.

-- 1) CAST Syntax 
----------------
-- CAST(<Expression> AS DataType)
---------------------------------
-- CAST Example 1)   -- from DateTime to date
SELECT orderid,orderdate AS OrderDateTime,
	   CAST(orderdate AS DATE) AS OrderDateOnly  
FROM   Orders 

Select 'Total : ' + Cast (100 as nvarchar(5))

Select Concat('Total : ' ,100 ,' $')
-- CAST Example 2)    -- from Int to String
SELECT CAST(1 AS Varchar(1))    AS RESULT 

-- CAST Example 2)    -- from String to Decimal
SELECT CAST('20.33' AS decimal(4,2))    AS RESULT 

---------------------------------------------------
-- 2) Convert Syntax 
------------------
-- 1) Normal             CONVERT(DataType , <Expression> ), "Optional Format")
-- 2) With Format        CONVERT(DataType , <Expression> , "Optional Format Number")
--------------------------------------------------------
-- CONVERT Example 1)   -- from DateTime to date

Select  Convert (nvarchar(5) , 100 )+ ' Degree'
SELECT orderid,orderdate AS OrderDateTime,CONVERT(DATE , orderdate , 110) AS OrderDateOnly  
FROM Orders 

-- CONVERT Example 2)    -- from Int to String
SELECT CONVERT(Varchar(1) , 1)  AS RESULT 

-- CONVERT Example 2)    -- from String to Decimal
SELECT CONVERT(Decimal(4,2) , '20.33' )   AS RESULT 
------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3) Parse Syntax 
-----------------
-- 1) Normal          PARS (<String> AS DataType)
-- 2) With Culture    PARS (<String> AS DataType USING 'Culture Name') 
-----------------------------------------------------
-- Parse Example Normal
SELECT PARSE('02/12/2012' AS datetime2) AS Result
Select isDate('2-30-2025') -- MM,DD,YYYY
-- Parse Example Using Culture
SELECT PARSE('02/12/2012' AS datetime2 USING 'ar-EG') AS Result
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
-- Why Try_Parse & Try_Convert ? 
---------------------------------
   - Some Conversion Never works 
   - If the data types are incompatible, 
   - such as attempting to convert a date to a numeric value,
   - (CAST,CONVERT,Parse)  will return an error.
   - So Try_Parse & Try_Convert Will Act Like (CONVERT,Parse) ,
   - AND When Conversion Failed Return NULL instead of Error.
   - Try_Parse Syntax = Parse Syntax
   - Try_Convert Syntax = Convert Syntax
*/
-- Conversion Failed with error like :-
-- CAST Error
SELECT CAST ( '12/12/2012' AS INT )

-- CONVERT Error
SELECT CONVERT ( INT , '12/12/2012' )
-- Parse Error
SELECT Parse ( '12/12/2012' AS INT )
-- USING Try_Parse    -- No Error
SELECT Try_Parse ( '12/12/2012' AS INT ) AS Result

  -- Logical Functions :- 
  -------------------------
    - Logical functions that evaluate an expression and return a scalar result.
	- Logical functions :- 
	                      A) ISNUMERIC() :- 
						               - Tests whether an input expression is a valid numeric data type.
						               - Returns a 1 when the input evaluates to any valid numeric type.
									   - Returns 0 otherwise
  
						  B) IIF()  :- 
						               - IIF returns one of two values, depending on a logical test.
									   - Like two-outcome CASE expression.
									   - You may nest a IIF function within another IIF, a maximum level 10.
									   - IIF give error if values NULL.

						  C) CHOOSE() :-
						               - returns an item from a list as specified by an index value.
									   - if the index value not a value in the list, will return a NULL.

-- CHOOSE() Syntax
-- CHOOSE (<Index_number>,Value_list)
--------------------------------------
-- CHOOSE() Example 1)  -- Simple Example
SELECT CHOOSE(1,'Spring','Summer','Autumn','Winter') AS Result
-- CHOOSE() Example 2)  -- Null because index number not in values list
SELECT CHOOSE(5,'Spring','Summer','Autumn','Winter') AS Result
-- CHOOSE() Example 3)  -- error if index Char.

				   - returns the first non-NULL value in a list.
				   - If all arguments are NULL, COALESCE returns NULL.

	  C)- NULLIF()  :-
	              - NULLIF is ANSI standard.

 -- Lesson 1) Introducing SQL Server 2016 Data Types :-
 -------------------------------------------------------
      -- SQL Server Data Types :-	
	  ---------------------------
	   - Data types specify the type, length, precision, and scale of data. 
	   - SQL Server associates columns, expressions, variables, and parameters with data types.
	   - Data types determine what kind of data can be held:-
                                       Integers, characters, dates, money, binary strings, etc.
	   - SQL Server supplies :- 
	   1) Built-in data types.  
	   2) User defined custom data types.

	   - SQL Server Data types Categories :-  -- Please See Images 
	   -------------------------------------

	                                   - Exact Numeric.
									   - Approximate Numeric.
									   - Data & Time.
									   - Character Strings.
									   - Unicode Characters.
									   - Binary Strings.
									   - Others
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		 Numeric Data Types :-
		--------------------------
           1) Exact Numeric:-
		   -------------------
			  - Integers :-    TinyInt , SmallInt , Int , BigInt .

			  - Decimal Or Numeric :-  Decimal Is ANSI Standard ,
			                           Numeric is kept for compatibility with earlier versions of SQL Server.

			  - Money & SmallMoney :- Money(8byte) Smallmoney(4byte) are also exact and map to Decimal and have 4 decimal points.

			  - Bit :-  1 , 0 OR NULL . 
		  2) Approximate Numeric :-
		   -------------------------
			  - Float :-  Like DECIMAL but only 6 right point of the decimal ,
			              Will Approximate values .
			         FLOAT(24) :- range 1 to 24 = 4bytes
			         FLOAT(53) :- range 25 to 53 = 8bytes

			  - Real :-  ISO synonym for float(24) = 4bytes
*/

-- 3) Binary String Data Types :-
---------------------------------
         - Binary string data types allow a developer to store binary information,
		   Such as serialized files, images, bytestreams, and other specialized data.

              - BINARY(n)       :- Fixed-width   = n bytes
              - VARBINARY(n)    :- Varying-width = n bytes + 2bytes
			  - VARBINARY(MAX)  :- MAX-Width 1-2.1 billion bytes = Actual length + 2bytes
*/
-- Example Binary
DECLARE @BINARY BINARY(4) = 123
SELECT @BINARY
GO
-- Example VarBinary
DECLARE @VARBINARY VARBINARY(5) = 12321
SELECT @VARBINARY
GO
-- Example VarBinary(max)
DECLARE @VARBINARY VARBINARY(MAX) = 12312111
SELECT @VARBINARY
GO
/*
-- 4) Other Data Types :-  -- Rarely Used
---------------------------
   - In addition to numeric and binary types, SQL Server also supplies some other data types,
     allowing you to store and process XML, generate globally unique identifiers (GUIDs),
	 represent hierarchies, and more. Some of these have limited use, others are more generally useful.

         - Rowversion       :-  Binary value, auto-incrementing when a row in a table is inserted or updated.

		 - Uniqueidentifier :-  Provides a mechanism for an automatically generated value that is unique across multiple systems.
		                        It is stored as a 16 byte value. by using the NEWID() system function.

		 - XML              :-  Allows the storage and manipulation of eXtensible Markup Language data. 
		                        This data type stores up to 2 GB of data per instance of the type. 
							    
		 - Cursors          :-  listed here for completeness. A SQL Server cursor is not a data type for storing data,
		                        But rather for use in variables or stored procedures .

		 - Hierarchyid      :-  Used to store hierarchical position data, such as levels of an organizational chart or bill of materials.
		                        SQL Server stores hierarchy data as binary data and exposes it through builtin functions. 
 
		 - SQL_variant      :-  Column data type that can store other common data types.
		                        Its use is not a best practice for typical data storage and may indicate design problems. 

		 - Table            :-  You will learn more about table types later in this course. 
		                        Note that table types cannot be used as a data type for a column (such as to store nested tables).

- Collations are collections of properties that govern several aspects of character data:-
    • Supported languages 
	• Sort order 
	• Case sensitivity 
	• Accent sensitivity  

- Note A default collation is established during the installation of SQL Server but can be overridden on a per-database or per-column basis.
