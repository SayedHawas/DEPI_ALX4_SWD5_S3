--Lesson 1: Using Views
		Writing Queries That Return Results from Views
		Creating Simple Views
		Demonstration: Using Views

Views may be referenced in a SELECT statement just like a table
Views are named table expressions with definitions stored in a database
Like derived tables and CTEs, queries that use views can provide encapsulation and simplification
From an administrative perspective, views can provide a security layer to a database


*/
--=================================================================
--Creating Simple Views
-------------------------
--Views are saved queries created in a database by administrators and developers
--Views are defined with a single SELECT statement
--ORDER BY is not permitted in a view definition without the use of TOP, OFFSET/FETCH, or FOR XML
--To sort the output, use ORDER BY in the outer query
--View creation supports additional options beyond the scope of this class

go
Create view VW_ShowEmployees
as
select EmployeeId , Firstname , Lastname ,Country  
from employees
where EmployeeId >5
go

--Now You Can call view 
select * from VW_ShowEmployees
--With Where 
select * from VW_ShowEmployees where country='UK'
--With Order By
select * from VW_ShowEmployees where country='UK' order by Firstname
--============================================================================
--Lesson 2: Using Inline TVFs
--------------------------------
--Writing Queries That Use Inline TVFs
--Creating Simple Inline TVFs
--Retrieving from Inline TVFs
--Demonstration: Inline TVFs

--Writing Queries That Use Inline TVFs
---------------------------------------
--TVFs are named table expressions with definitions stored in a database
--TVFs return a virtual table to the calling query
--SQL Server provides two types of TVFs:
--Inline, based on a single SELECT statement
--Multi-statement, which creates and loads a table variable
--Unlike views, TVFs support input parameters
--Inline TVFs may be thought of as parameterized views


--Creating Simple Inline TVFs:-
--------------------------------
--TVFs are created by administrators and developers
--Create and name function and optional parameters with CREATE FUNCTION
--Declare return type as TABLE
--Define inline SELECT statement following RETURN



GO
Create function Fn_ShowEmployeeOrder (@employeeId int)
returns table 
as 
return Select * from Orders Where EmployeeID =@employeeId
GO
Select * from Fn_ShowEmployeeOrder(1)
Select * from Fn_ShowEmployeeOrder(3)




go
Create function Fn_test(@OID int)
returns table 
as 
return select orderId ,Quantity ,UnitPrice,cast(quantity * unitprice as decimal(9,2)) as Total
       from [Order Details]
	   where OrderID = @OID;
go
select * from fn_test(10248) 


-----------------  ----Demo on Function ----------------------------------
-- string Function
  go 
  create function Fun_MyStringFun(@x nvarchar(100))
  returns nvarchar(100)
  begin 
   return (Concat(Upper( substring(ltrim(@x),1,1)) ,lower(substring (ltrim(@x),2,len(@x)))))

--Writing Queries with Derived Tables
--------------------------------------
--Derived tables are named query expressions created within an outer SELECT statement
--Not stored in database—represents a virtual relational table
--When processed, unpacked into query against underlying referenced objects
--Allow you to write more modular queries

--SELECT <column_list>
--FROM	(

--Scope of a derived table is the query in which it is defined
/*
--Notes 
-------
--Derived Tables Must:-
------------------------
1-Have an alias
2-Have names for all columns
3-Have unique names for all columns
4-Not use an ORDER BY clause (without TOP or OFFSET/FETCH)
5-Not be referred to multiple times in the same query

Derived Tables May:-
---------------------
1-Use internal or external aliases for columns
2-Refer to parameters and/or variables
3-Be nested within other derived tables

*/
--Column aliases may be defined inline:
SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT customerID) AS cust_count
FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, CustomerID FROM Orders) AS derived_year
GROUP BY orderyear;

--Column aliases may be defined externally:
SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS cust_count
FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate), CustomerID FROM Orders) AS derived_year(orderyear, custid)
GROUP BY orderyear;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Passing Arguments to Derived Tables
--Derived tables may refer to arguments
--Arguments might be:
--Variables declared in the same batch as the SELECT statement
--Parameters passed into a table-valued function or stored procedure

DECLARE @empid INT = 9;
SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS cust_count
FROM (SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, customerID FROM Orders WHERE EmployeeID=@empid) AS derived_year

 Module 13
 Using Window Ranking, Offset, and Aggregate Functions
--------------------------------------------------------
 Lessons :-
--------------
               1) Creating Windows with OVER.
			   2) Exploring Window Functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 1) Creating Windows with OVER :-
------------------------------------------
A) SQL Windowing
-----------------
	            - Windows extend T-SQL's set-based approach.
				- Windows allow you to specify an order as part of a calculation, 
				          without regard to order of input or final output order
			    - Windows allow partitioning and framing of rows to support functions.
				- Window functions can simplify queries that need to find running totals, moving averages, or gaps in data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B) Using OVER () 
-----------------
	           - OVER defines a window, or set, of rows to be used by a window function, including any ordering.
			   - With a partition clause, OVER clause restricts the set of rows to those with the same values in the partitioning elements
			   - By itself, OVER() is unrestricted and includes all rows.
			   - Multiple OVER clauses can be used in a single query, each with its own partitioning and ordering, if needed.
	Syntax :-
	----------
	OVER ( [ <PARTITION BY clause> ] 
	       [ <ORDER BY clause> ] 
	       [ <ROWS or RANGE clause> ] 
	     ) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C) Partitioning Windows
-------------------------
		       - Partitioning limits a set to rows with same value in the partitioning column.
			   - Use PARTITION BY in the OVER() clause
               - Without a PARTITION BY clause defined, OVER() creates a single partition of all rows
*/
-- PARTITION BY Example :-
SELECT ProductID,OrderID ,Quantity, SUM(Quantity) OVER ( PARTITION BY ProductID ) AS Total_Quantity_For_Product
FROM  [Order Details]
GO
Use Northwind
GO
Select * from [Order Details]
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D) Ordering and Framing :-
-----------------------------
    - Window framing allows you to set start and end boundaries within a window partition.
	- UNBOUNDED means go all the way to boundary in direction specified by PRECEDING or FOLLOWING (start or end).
	- CURRENT ROW indicates start or end at current row in partition.
	- ROWS BETWEEN allows you to define a range of rows between two points.
	- Window ordering provides a context to the frame :- 
	        A) Sorting by an attribute enables meaningful position of a boundary
            B) Without ordering, "start at first row" is not useful because a set has no order
*/
Select * , Sum(Quantity) over(Partition By ProductID Order By Quantity ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) from [Order Details]


SELECT ProductID,OrderID,Quantity,
       SUM(Quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY Quantity ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RunningQty 
FROM [Order Details]
GO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
-- Lesson 2) Exploring Window Functions :-
-------------------------------------------
           - A window function is a function applied to a window, or set, of rows.
		   - Window functions include aggregate, ranking, distribution, and offset functions
		   - Window functions depend on set created by OVER()
*/

-- Window Aggregate Functions
SELECT   ProductID,Quantity,
		 SUM(Quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID) AS "Total Quantity For Product",
         AVG(Quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID) AS "Average Quantity For Product"   
FROM   [Order Details]

-- Window Ranking Function
1
-- With Over 
SELECT   ProductID,UnitPrice,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY UnitPrice) AS "Row Number",
	     RANK() OVER (ORDER BY UnitPrice) AS Rank,
	     DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY UnitPrice) AS "Dense Rank"
FROM   Products

-- Window Ranking Functions
-- With OVER AND Partition BY
SELECT   ProductID, UnitPrice,
		 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ProductID) AS "Row Number",
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY ProductID) AS "Row Number Partition"

*) Window offset functions allow comparisons between rows in a set without the need for a self-join
*) Offset functions operate on a position relative to the current row, or to the start or end of the window frame

LAG:-
-----
Returns an expression from a previous row that is a defined offset from the current row. 
Returns NULL if no row at specified position.

Pivoting and Grouping Sets
---------------------------
-- lessons :-
--------------
	      -1 Writing Queries with PIVOT and UNPIVOT. 
          -2 Working with Grouping Sets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 1) PIVOT & UNPIVOT :- 
---------------------------------
  -- PIVOT :-
  ------------
           - Pivoting data is rotating data from a rows-based orientation to a columns-based orientation.
		   - Pivoting includes three phases :-
                       1) Grouping    :- Determines from FROM clause which element gets a row in the result set 
                       2) Spreading   :- Provides the distinct values to be pivoted across
                       3) Aggregation :- Performs an aggregation function (such as SUM,Count,etc..)
  -- UNPIVOT :-
  -------------
			- Unpivoting data is the logical reverse of pivoting data
			- Instead of turning rows into columns, unpivot turns columns into rows.
			- This is a technique useful in taking data that has already been pivoted.
			- Unpivoting includes three elements :-
                          1) Source columns to be unpivoted
                          2) Name to be assigned to new values column
                          3) Name to be assigned to names columns
			- Unpivoting does not restore the original data. 
			- Detail-level data was lost during the aggregation process in the original pivot.
			- UNPIVOT has no ability to allocate values to return to original detail values.

Pivoting and Grouping Sets
---------------------------
-- lessons :-
--------------
	      -1 Writing Queries with PIVOT and UNPIVOT. 
          -2 Working with Grouping Sets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 1) PIVOT & UNPIVOT :- 
---------------------------------
  -- PIVOT :-
  ------------
           - Pivoting data is rotating data from a rows-based orientation to a columns-based orientation.
		   - Pivoting includes three phases :-
                       1) Grouping    :- Determines from FROM clause which element gets a row in the result set 
                       2) Spreading   :- Provides the distinct values to be pivoted across
                       3) Aggregation :- Performs an aggregation function (such as SUM,Count,etc..)
  -- UNPIVOT :-
  -------------
			- Unpivoting data is the logical reverse of pivoting data
			- Instead of turning rows into columns, unpivot turns columns into rows.
			- This is a technique useful in taking data that has already been pivoted.
			- Unpivoting includes three elements :-
                          1) Source columns to be unpivoted
                          2) Name to be assigned to new values column
                          3) Name to be assigned to names columns
			- Unpivoting does not restore the original data. 
			- Detail-level data was lost during the aggregation process in the original pivot.
			- UNPIVOT has no ability to allocate values to return to original detail values.

Lesson 1: Querying Data with Stored Procedures
-----------------------------------------------
			Examining Stored Procedures
			Executing Stored Procedures


Examining Stored Procedures
	- Stored procedures are collections of T-SQL statements stored in a database
	- Procedures can return results, manipulate data, and perform administrative actions on the server
	- With other objects, procedures can provide a trusted application programming interface to a database, insulating applications from database structure changes
			* Use views, functions, and procedures to return data
			* Use procedures to modify and add new data
			* Alter procedure definition in one place, rather than update application code

Executing Stored Procedures
      -Invoke a stored procedure using EXECUTE or EXEC
      -Call procedure with two-part name
      -Pass parameters in @name=value form, using appropriate data type

/*
Parameters are defined in the header of the procedure code, including name, data type and direction (input is default)
Parameters are discoverable using SQL Server Management Studio and the sys.parameters view
To pass parameters in an EXEC statement, use names defined in procedure

--Introducing T-SQL Batches
---------------------------
 1) T-SQL batches are collections of one or more T-SQL statements 
     sent to SQL Server as a unit for parsing, optimization, and execution
 2) Batches are terminated with GO by default
 3) Batches are boundaries for variable scope
 4) Some statements (for example, CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE VIEW) 
	may not be combined with others in the same batch


CREATE VIEW <view_name>
AS ...;
GO
CREATE PROCEDURE <procedure_name>
AS ...;
GO

-----------------------
--Working with Batches

     *) Batches are parsed for syntax as a unit
     *) Syntax errors cause the entire batch to be rejected
     *) Runtime errors may allow the batch to continue after failure, by default
Batches can contain error-handling code

 Implementing Error Handling
-----------------------------------


-- lessons :-
--------------
       
	    1- Using TRY / CATCH Blocks.
		2- Working with Error Information.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Lesson 1) Using TRY / CATCH Blocks :-
--------------------------------------------

   - Try...Catch paradigm it is basically two blocks of code with your stored procedures 
     that lets you execute some code, this is the Try section and if there are errors they are handled in the Catch section. 

   - Structured exception handling allows a centralized response to runtime errors :-
                          A) TRY to run a block of commands and CATCH any errors
						  B) Execution moves to the CATCH block of commands when an error occurs
						  C) No need to check every statement to see if an error occurred
						  D) You decide whether the transaction should be rolled back, errors logged, etc.

   - Not all errors can be caught by TRY / CATCH :- 
                          A) Syntax or compile errors.
						  B) Some name resolution errors.

   - TRY block defined by BEGIN TRY...END TRY statements :-
                          A) Place all code that might raise an error between them
						  B) No code may be placed between END TRY and BEGIN CATCH
						  C) TRY and CATCH blocks may be nested
						  D) CATCH block defined by BEGIN CATCH...END CATCH

   - Execution moves to the CATCH block when catchable errors occur within the TRY block
*/

-- Example
-- SQL SERVER 2000
SELECT 1 /0 --perform an operation 
IF @@ERROR<> 0   PRINT 'Error :P hahahah :P'
GO

-- SQL SERVER 2005 - 2016 
-- TRY ---- CATCH 

-- Example 
-- Create Stored Procedure
Create PROC Test1
@First int, @Second int
AS
BEGIN TRY 
SELECT @First/@Second
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH 
SELECT (@First+@Second) *2
END CATCH
GO

-- Run it , no error , 'Catch not working'
EXEC TEST1 4,2   -- No Error

-- Run it to get errro ' Catch working '
EXEC TEST1 10,0   -- Error 10/0 Can't happen

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
-- Lesson 2) Working with Error Information  :-
--------------------------------------------

          - SQL Server provides a set of metadata about runtime errors 
		    that may be queried (usually in a CATCH block) to return information about runtime errors.
		
		  - See Images Folder...

		  - SQL Server 2012 provides the new THROW statement.
		  - THROW enables you to include error-handling code in a CATCH block 
		    to raise the original runtime error and pass it to an upper layer,
		    such as a calling procedure or client application. 

		 - In previous versions of SQL Server, 
		   developers and administrators used the RAISERROR function to pass user-defined error messages to procedures and client applications.

		 - Use THROW instead of RAISERROR .
*/

-- Example For Error System Functions
-------------------------------------
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 1/0
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT ERROR_NUMBER() AS ErrorNumber
     ,ERROR_SEVERITY() AS ErrorSeverity
     ,ERROR_STATE() AS ErrorState
     ,ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS ErrorProcedure
     ,ERROR_LINE() AS ErrorLine
     ,ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
END CATCH
GO

-- Example For THROW :-
-- Anywhere 
------------------------
THROW 50002,  -- this number is message number , USER range of 50000 to 2147483647. , System range 1-49999
'I Can send any message any time :P :P ',1


-- Example For THROW :-
-- With TRY....CATCH :-
------------------------
BEGIN TRY
	SELECT 100/0 AS 'Problem'
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
	PRINT 'error :P';
	THROW 50022,'Type Anything You Want',16
END CATCH



/*
-- How to read SQL Server error messages :- 
-------------------------------------------

Here is a typical error message:-

Server: Msg 547, Level 16, State 1, Line # Message Text….
---------------------------------------------------------------------

select * from sys.messages

1) Message number :- 
               - Each error message has a number. You can find most of the message numbers in the table sysmessages.
			   - (There some special numbers like 0 and 50000 that do not appear there.) 
			   - Message numbers from 50001 and up are user-defined. Lower numbers are system defined.


2) Severity level :-
               - A number from 0 to 25. If the severity level is in the range 0-10, the message is informational or a warning, and not an error.
			   - Errors resulting from programming errors in your SQL code have a severity level in the range 11-16. 
			   - Severity levels 17-25 indicate resource problems, hardware problems or internal problems in SQL Server, 
			     and a severity of 20 or higher is fatal, the connection will be terminated.

3) State :-
               - a value between 0 and 127. 
			   - The meaning of this item is specific to the error messages. 
			   - Microsoft has not documented these values.

4) Line :-
               - Line number within the procedure/function/trigger/batch the error occurred.
			   - A line number of 0 indicates that the problem occurred when the procedure was invoked.

5) Message text :-
               - The actual text of the message that tells you what went wrong.
			   - You can find this text in master..sysmessages, or rather a template for it, with placeholders for names of databases, tables etc.


-- These levels are documented in in the section :-

Module 18
Implementing Transactions
-----------------------------
-- lessons :-
--------------
	   1- Transactions and the Database Engine.
	   2- Controlling Transactions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 1) Transactions and the Database Engine  :-
-------------------------------------------------------
       - A transaction is a group of tasks defining a unit of work.
	   - The entire unit must succeed or fail together – no partial completion is permitted.
       - Individual data modification statements are automatically treated as standalone transactions.
       - User transactions can be managed with T-SQL commands: BEGIN/ COMMIT/ROLLBACK TRANSACTION.
	   - SQL Server uses locking mechanisms and the transaction log to support transactions.
	   - Transaction commands identify blocks of code that must succeed or fail together,
	         and provide points where database engine can roll back, or undo, operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lesson 2) Controlling Transactions  :-
-------------------------------------------
    - BEGIN TRANSACTION :-
	----------------------
	        - BEGIN TRANSACTION marks the starting point of an explicit, user-defined transaction.
			- Transactions last until :-
			               A) COMMIT statement is issued.
			               B) ROLLBACK is manually issued. 
						   C) The connection is broken and the system issues a ROLLBACK.
			- In your T-SQL code: Mark the start of the transaction's work.
	- COMMIT TRANSACTION :-
	-----------------------
	        - COMMIT ensures all of the transaction's modifications are made a permanent part of the database.
			- COMMIT frees resources, such as locks, used by the transaction
			- In your T-SQL code: If a transaction is successful, commit it.
	- ROLLBACK TRANSACTION :-
	-------------------------
	        - A ROLLBACK statement undoes all modifications made in the transaction ,
			  by reverting the data to the state it was in at the beginning of the transaction .
			- ROLLBACK frees resources, such as locks, held by the transaction.
			- Before rolling back, you can test the state of the transaction with the XACT_STATE function.
			- In your T-SQL code: If an error occurs, ROLLBACK to the point of the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement.
	- Using XACT_ABORT :- 
	-----------------------
	        - SQL Server does not automatically roll back transactions when errors occur.
			- To roll back, either use ROLLBACK statements in error-handling logic or enable XACT_ABORT.
			- XACT_ABORT specifies whether SQL Server automatically rolls back the current transaction when a runtime error occurs.
			- SET XACT_ABORT OFF is the default setting.
			- Change XACT_ABORT value with the SET command :- " SET XACT_ABORT ON "
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Understanding of Transactions and Locks
-- ---------------------------------------
-- Review On Transactions:
-- ----------------------
-1- Transactions allow you to define a unit of activity that will be considered 
    atomic :all or nothing.
-2- Transactions are known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).
    * Atomicity ( One Failed All Failed )
    * Consistency ( Data must be in a good form )
    * Isolation (Transaction must be isolated from others ) 
    * Durability (Transaction must be permanent in DB )
-3- Note : Whenever you submit a change to the database, SQL Server first checks 
           whether the pages that need to be affected already reside in cache.
           If they do, the pages are modified in cache. 
           If they don't, they're first loaded from disk into the cache and modified
           there. 
     -SQL Server records the changes in the database's transaction log. 
     Once in a while, a process called checkpoint flushes changed pages 
     ("dirty pages") from cache to the data portion of the database on disk.
-- Every transaction is recorded on DB log to  later recovery (Demonstration)
   Committed   --Rollforward ,written to DB
   Uncommitted --Rollback
-- Locking is used to prevent users from reading data  
   that is in the process of being modified
-- Locking is automatic.
-- Without locking, the database may become logically  incorrect, 
   updates may be lost, and queries against the data may produce 
   unexpected results.
-- SQL server automatically manages locking on the database or its objects OR -
   You Can use locking hints, 
   you use special statements to configure the rules for setting and    
   releasing locks. However, using locking hints is not recommended. 
-- Two main types of lock:
		Read locks – Allow others to read but not write
		Write locks – Stop others from reading or writing
-- Locks prevent update conflicts

When writing queries, it is sometimes necessary 
to learn which columns are in a particular table, what their data types are, or what collation is used by a 
string column. You may not have convenient access to a graphical tool such as SQL Server Management 
Studio (SSMS); however, if you can send queries to SQL Server, you can retrieve the same information that 
SSMS displays. After all, SSMS is simply issuing metadata queries on your behalf in order to display its view 
of a server or a database. 

SQL Server provides access to structured metadata through a variety of mechanisms, such as :
1- system catalog views, 
2- system functions, 
3- dynamic management objects, 
4- system stored procedures.

 you need to adjust your queries accordingly. 
-They may not expose all the metadata available to SQL Server's own catalog views. 
 For example, sys.columns includes attributes for the identity property and computed column property, while 
 INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns does not. 
  
-Return system metadata per ISO standard, used by third-party tools
